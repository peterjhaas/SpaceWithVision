## About
Making motion pictures, like all art, is an active process — transforming a subject from an inert state of merely being observed, into an experience that is immersive and experiential. A space with vision is a place that serves as a chrysalis for this process: it is a zone of creativity where meaningful creative works are produced and shared.

This publication documents various expeditions into the dynamic creative process and philosophy of crafting motion pictures.

## Where to Read
Currently, the primary platform for Space with Vision is [Substack](https://spacewithvision.substack.com), yet knowing how the winds of time change every platform, we're currently looking into other ways of preserving our work for readers.  Materials we post on Github and Archive.org are a result of our current experiment in finding new and interesting ways to provide access to our work without getting locked into a single platform.

## Support
