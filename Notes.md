Mobile phones are a great resource for filmmakers, particularly in the documentary and micro-budget fiction fields.

The integrated photo and video apps are always limited and built with the consumer in mind (there is nothing wrong with that! Point and shoot cameras exist for a reason, right?) BUT there are some folks out there making som really wild stuff to make up for the shortfalls.

The first one I want to point out is __DIGILOG-CAMERA 500T__ from David Bross. This app functions as both a still and video camera and offers manual control options familiar to someone from a traditional camera background.

“This is not a filter,” Bross proclaims on his website “It builds the image from the raw sensor data. From de-linearization to a custom gamma curve, through color adjustments, to the final look.”

I’ve been using DigiLog-Camera for a few weeks on my iPhone 12 Mini and been stunned by the beautiful results coming off my greatly outdated camera hardware.

Bross’ project is worth checking out, and I look forward to giving this and future versions a try in longer-form workflows!
