# Masks

***On the subject of fast-fashion and the occupation of the inner-space of our souls.***

by Peter J. Haas and Léa Fae

<p>The legendary showman David “Bowie” Jones rarely interviewed or discussed his process but once offered a rare insight when he told a fan “I am always afraid.” In order to overcome the fear, Mr. Jones claimed to wear an invisible mask which protected his private self while performing.</p>

Mr. Jones was discussing the use of emotional masks, but you don’t have to look further than his glam rock days to realize that the out-of-this world wardrobe his characters dawned was certainly part of the barrier between the life of Mr. Jones and Bowie.

I too am always afraid.

Always.





 It’s an angst deeply rooted in social anxiety and has impeded relationships both personal and professional. As a working class artist attempting to carve out a living in New York City I struggle to maneuver my way through a complex world of lingo, social cues, and fashion signaling beyond the reaches of my socio-economic education.

If you were to ask my friends, I would probably be the last person that would come to mind when it comes to writing about fashion. Despite never considering myself “seriously” fashionable, I’ve always been greatly concerned with fashion. My interest in the subject is deeply rooted in a place of anxiety: Am I wearing the right outfit to this networking event? How about that job interview? Are these the correct pair of jeans to be wearing to work or not? Am I supposed to be even be wearing jeans?!





These anxieties aren’t unique by a long shot, after all, if you’re going on a date, is not “Oh my god, what am I going to wear?!” at the top of your list of concerns?

There’s a noticeable trend in modern fashion, particularly amongst those of the “fast” variety to capitalizes on the ever fading line between our work and personal lives: wear a suit to the office, then if/when you finally clock off, roll up the sleeves and unbutton that fashionable collar and you’re out on the town with the boys. 

Post COVID-19 lockdown “Athleisure” and  “business extremely casual” have become their own genres of “ultra-comfy” work-acceptable clothes — suggesting they are ideal for any combination of the words “Home” and “Office”.  The reformation of office-appropriate work is a surface level aspect of this blurring: the ability to wear the same outfit to your online Yoga class  as a work video conference call might read as an unceremonious convenience; but something more malicious is happening with this frictionless transition.

The term “blurring lines” is commonly used to describe how our work lives are becoming even more entwined with our personal ones; how we’re working longer hours for less pay, missing out on that time with our families and friends so we can meet a deadline. The writer and cultural theorist Mark Fisher preferred to use the more fitting word “occupation” to describe how Capitalism and Neoliberalism has set its sights on the inner-space of our souls.

In his book Capitalist Realism Fisher asks:

“[Capitalism] having all-too successfully incorporated externality, how can it function without an outside it can colonize and appropriate?” Since Capitalism has run out of external markets to consume, is it any wonder that the Capitalist machine has turned its sights to the “Inner-Space” of human existence?

Occupations are a complicated and messy affairs. In the course of expanding their power, those doing the occupying get to engage in quite a bit appropriation in the process: pillaging what they perceive to be of value while leaving the occupied the option to collaborate, assimilate, or face the consequences.

Fisher described this Neoliberal occupation in the broader context of our lives and imaginations, but there are many practical considerations that equally play into the concept. After becoming our sole viable source of providing shelter, sustenance, and basic medical needs, is it any wonder these systems have attempted to become a source of deeper meaning as well?

With each passing year we are expected to give up more of ourselves, assimilate to the supreme needs of the job. Of course this often plays out in less of a totalitarian tone than one might suspect. Take, for instance, the recent uptick in companies urging their employees to “enjoy the freedom of self expression.” Yet, with hiring trends such as “culture fit” becoming common place, visible self expression has evolved into a nearly essential element of employment.

Economic fears bolstered by a strong self-help industry, social media, and the competitive nature of US workaholic culture has deeply ingrained the exalted “culture fit” qualities into our off the clock lives as we’re inundated with commercial pressures to be well manicured, totally optimized, sexy (but not too sexy!), easily likable, and uncontroversial in any meaningful way.

Oh, and of course, don’t forget to “dress the part”! But be careful to not dress too down, because then you’re not caring enough; and don’t dress up too much because then you’ll read as desperate.  A good, hirable employee is one that truly internalizes these ideals, and is applying them to live their #blessed #bestlives. In other words, the ideal employee has been occupied primarily by the qualities that are most beneficial to the company for which they work.







This all sounds infinitely bleak. If recent history has taught us anything it’s that there are no easy answers, no quick-fix solutions to larger societal issues regardless of how dire they may seem. But not all is lost. I take solace in the fact that power begins with knowledge; when we begin to understand how these forces are attempting to mold us, we can begin to fight back their occupation.

The many masks and personae dawned by David Bowie call to mind the Japanese concepts of tatemae and honne; tatemae being the face one puts on display for the outside world, while honne is the true-self, often kept hidden from all but those closest to you.

There are numerous examples of tense confrontational moments between Bowie and various talk show hosts who pried too deep into his personal matters. It is through the application of a strong tatemae, Jones/Bowie was able to interface with the world required by his work, but also hold onto himself and protect both his privacy but his honne,

David could be Jones at home and Bowie on stage. In a similar way, we cannot allow our tatemae, our work masks to become glued to our faces. Our jobs are not entitled to our honne, this last most precious piece of us that transcends value.

I’ve said it elsewhere, but it’s worth repeating. Go write a bad poem, sing a song out of key in the shower, learn to knit, sun bath with a library book, make a hand drawn zine with stick figures; anything that makes you laugh and doesn’t get you wrapped up in making sales or unhealthy competition.

We owe it to each other to not only fight for free time, but the ability to keep that time spiritually free from the grasp of work.

It’s here that I want to turn to the wonderful photography included in this article. Each of these images presents a professional personae that occupies a space in my life. They are pieces of my tatemae, my masks to the outside world, the uniform you’ll see me wrapped in when I’m work. I love them because they make me feel incredibly seen and beautiful. You might be asking, which one of these is my true self? I’m not sharing that here — because those details, those little secrets are for me.

Bowie’s final album ★ (BLACKSTAR) was released on his 69th birthday, just two days before he died. The otherwise dark, and poignant record ends with an enlightening bittersweet track entitled “I can’t give it all away...”

David Jones never did, and neither should we.
