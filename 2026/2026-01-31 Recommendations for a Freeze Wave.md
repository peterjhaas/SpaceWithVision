# Recommendations for a Freeze-Wave

*It’s been cold here in New York City. Very cold. Mostly staying inside. Watching some stuff.*

by Peter J. Haas

No, seriously, it has been historically and dangerously cold. As a New Englander by birth, I'm less annoyed by the cold than the city's inability to manage snow. NYC infrastructure definitely has never been equipped to handle prolonged subfreezing temperatures and any real volume of snow. Ranting aside, — it looks like we’re in for another week of disruptively low temperatures, making it a really great week to stay inside whenever possible.

This snow-induced mild cloistering has granted me the opportunity to conduct some development research for a new horror picture. In the spirit of camaraderie I thought it would be fun to share what I’ve been watching.

Stay warm and be safe everybody!

## THE PLAGUE (2025), dir. Charlie Polinger.

Polinger’s debut feature film is visually intense, unapologetic examination of those chaotic early teenage years so steeped in anxiety, fear, and self-discovery. Set in the early aughts, THE PLAUGE avoids nostalgia baiting. Polinger offers a pragmatic glimpse into an era struggling to define itself at the dawn of the new millennium. The performances are great all around, it’s a rare treat to see so much youthful talent on the big screen! Seek out this film.

# THE THING (1982), dir. John Carpenter.

I know this is low-hanging fruit, but _come on man_, this wouldn’t be a list about surviving NYC’s Freeze-Wave without THE THING. Besides, it’s important milestone for Carpenter’s horror masterpiece: THE THING was recently added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for “preservation due to its cultural, historic or aesthetic importance.”

## VAMPYROS LESBOS (1971), dir. Franco Manera.

If THE THING is reminding you too much of the cold, how about something a little spicy? Mysterious, erotic, dream-inspired, VAMPYROS LESBOS is one of those films that transcends expectations of the controversial and indulgent horror pulp genre. Yes, this film has its flaws (which one doesn’t?), but Manera’s take on the traditional vampire story remains an incredibly hypnotic experience.

Somewhat outshining the film itself (at least commercially), the soundtrack was released as an album entitled _Vampyros Lesbos: Sexadelic Dance Party._ It was a huge hit in Europe. This one is a blast to listen to, especially if you’re prone to dancing when nobody is watching.

# QUATERMASS AND THE PIT (1958/67).

This serialized BBC program came to my attention during my re-reading of Mark Fisher’s _The Weird and the Erie_. The writer of all things _Quatermass_, Nigel Kneale, has a unique (and very British) take on the unearthing of the horrors of the past.

BBC Preview of the film's new HD remastering:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKcat04pM8 

In the US the series can be difficult to track down, so I would also recommend [the Hammer Films remake of the same title](https://youtu.be/XTiZJFRRlwE) from 1967. Oh! While you’re at it, read [_The Weird and the Eerie_](https://repeaterbooks.com/product/the-weird-and-the-eerie/).

# THE MORBID ZOO, dir. Mariana Colín.

I’ve been doing a lot of research regarding the Horror Genre lately and was lucky enough to have The Algorithm™ recommend this great video by Mariana Colín — [_The Morbid Zoo: The Philosophy of Final Destination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKQ6DsEj5y4)._

Colín, a PhD Candidate in Communications/Media Anthropology, is an absolutely stellar artist: contextualizing cerebral academic topics with approachability, humor, and wit. The result is in an incredibly informative and entertaining resource for anyone with an interested in horror and horror-adjacent subjects!
