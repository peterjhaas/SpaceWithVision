# 🍷 You Are All Wrong.
*Defending Herzog’s Ecstatic Truth at New York’s Metrograph Theater.*

The warm glow of an overpriced glass of Riesling had hardly taken hold as I inconveniently found myself in the crossfire of a steadily escalating disagreement regarding the nature of “the truth” at New York’s infamous Metrograph theater.

My nerves were already on edge. The contract on my current job was ending soon, and nothing seemed on the horizon. Fueled with anxiety about the future, I had uncharacteristically interloped my way into a Members Only Event with hopes of engaging in some networking.

For those unfamiliar: the Metrograph is a small, independent, privately run repertory movie theater located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It is popular among New York’s young and hip crowd, particularly those with a professional interest in culture, the type who self-describe as cinephiles.

I worked my way into a conversation between a small cohort comprised of a Journalist, a Carhart Jacket wearing Guy clinging tightly to a Metrograph Branded-Tote-Bag, and a Software Developer. We discussed the various films everyone had been “screening”[^1]  as of late. I mentioned that I had recently rewatching LESSONS OF DARKNESS, Werner Herzog’s infamous 1992 Gulf War documentary.

[^1]: Please note: not watching, but screening. Apparently there is very important distinction that I am unaware of.

“Oh, Werner Herzog,” spat the journalist over her martini, “that fucking guy.”

A thick, fretted silence settled over the group. Anxiety was taking hold and I was nearly out of wine. Images of burning oil fields danced in my head.

The first Gulf War was coming to a close in the early months of 1991, retreating Iraqi forces set fire to hundreds of Kuwaiti oilfields leaving behind an unfathomable horror of flames and pitch-black smoke. For weeks, footage of the burning oilfields ran almost non-stop on the mass media news circuit.

These broadcasts captured the attention of filmmaker Werner Herzog, who took umbrage with their portrayal of the events: “The world had been saturated night and day with images of the burning oil fields,” recounts Herzog, “The networks and cable channels had filmed it all wrong; that tabloid style of reporting… and all too soon everyone had forgotten. I knew I was witnessing a momentous event that had to be recorded…for the memory of mankind.”

The resulting film, LESSONS OF DARKNESS (1992), is a brilliant work of non-fiction.

The film is primarily remembered for Herzog’s employment of long, sweeping aerial photography, setting the viewer adrift over a nightmarish landscape set aflame but most notable is the imaginative use of narrative framing. Voice over, provided by Herzog, describes the scenes as if from the perspective of an alien visitor, never identifying the exact location (or even the Planet Earth for that matter), cause of the conflict, or names of any of the subjects interviewed. In the great tradition of the Ecstatic Truth, Herzog constructs a poetic and stylized condemnation of the ways war scars the planet and those who experience its horrors.

Yet, despite the film’s accomplishments, Herzog’s approach was not without controversy. Upon screening LESSONS OF DARKNESS at the Berlin Film Festival, “Nearly two-thousand people rose up with a single voice in an angry roar.” reflects Herzog on his experience being mercilessly jeered, “They so hated the film…that when I walked down the aisle after the screening, people spat at me.”

What exactly happened here? What had turned the audience so against our beloved Werner? Encountering a similar visceral reaction to Herzog and his work by my new Journalist acquaintance surprised me a great deal. Metrograph was typically the favored venue for those seeking off-beat filmmaking. When pressed for details, she admitted “it’s because he, like, lies all the time in his documentaries.” Her hand traveled in a large, slow circle.

The encouragement of overpriced wine and a blog-in-progress never to be underestimated (I was in fact writing an article about this very topic), I pushed back on the usage of the word “lie,” offering instead the “ecstatic truth.”

Software Designer nodded in agreement, “Seems like it could be a helpful storytelling tool?” Tote-Bag-Guy swirled his drink, remaining neutral.

“For a documentary though? I don’t buy it.” Journalist wrinkled her nose, “I just don’t see how facts can’t be true in a documentary — that’s, like, so dangerous.”

I stood for a moment, searching the bottom of my glass of wine for a good response. After the 1992 showing of LESSONS OF DARKNESS in Berlin, Herzog took to the stage in front of a jeering crowd for a Q&A session. “You’re wrong,” he began, leaning closer into the microphone. “You’re wrong. All you cretins are wrong.” A courageous response to defending one’s work, but not exactly the correct approach to polite conversation.

“Hmm. Dangerous?” The words left my mouth before I knew what I was saying. Twenty years of documentary filmmaking skills reflexively kicked in: “I would love to hear more about that.”

The ensuing conversation with the Journalist gave me pause in writing this final installment of the Herzog Trilogy. As a scholar of the Rogue Film School, I was forced to ask myself “Am I so out of touch?”

I decided to take some time to engage in conversations with other creative types and journalists about their opinions on Herzog and his application of the Ecstatic/Emotional Truth to making non-fiction works. While most folks tended to express a love of Herzog as a quirky filmmaker, there was an overall negative sentiment regarding the ecstatic truth.

Documentary film is often misunderstood as a work of non-fiction used to disclose factual stories. This definition is too limiting: documentary, while often synonymous with non-fiction, should be viewed as a framework, not a dogma. It is a style-guide, offering a visual language and numerous approaches that can be applied to both fiction and non-fiction stories

The presence of the documentary format does not imply the presence of fact. Pictures such as SPINAL TAP, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, or any of the numerous episodes of DOCUMENTARY NOW put this style-guide to work and receive little pushback because they are obvious works of fiction. There is an expectation of fictional narratives to express emotional truths which connect to audiences in the real world.

Non-fiction works are best viewed as a spectrum: with journalism on one end (that is, sorting through a number of subjective truths to construct what is considered a reasonably accurate piece of information), “based-upon” sitting somewhere in the middle (these are stories told with the sort of energy comparable to what you might hear at a bar with friends, narratives that are rooted in fact but often contain wild embellishments), and finally at the opposite end of the spectrum: Op-Eds, Advertisements and Propaganda (media that is designed to control and influence behavior).

<!-- TK — Image of spectrum goes here. -->

The lines blur when telling non-fiction stories. Many people over-index for the journalism side of the spectrum and take great umbrage to the idea that the detailed truths of a non-fiction documentary might not be strictly factual.

The deeply emotional disdain for the subjective nature of the ecstatic truth is certainly linked to the current struggle in the United States to define what exactly constitutes a fact and who exactly gets to define them in the political and cultural space. This leads to a disturbing shift from the discussion of truth in an artistic context, separate from journalistic facts, from one of aesthetics to one of ethics and morality.

Too often facts are treated as beliefs. The idea of objective facts has taken on an aura of magical wisdom that can be revealed to someone who appropriately opens to their eyes to the “way things truly are,” or the “correct way of thinking.” It is important to remember that facts are not beliefs, and should change under certain circumstances. Deriving facts is a laborious process involving verification and assessment, which becomes more challenging the more complicated and nuanced a scenario. This process applies scrutiny to the information at hand, how it is observed and analyzed, and who is gathering it.

Facts do serve many important functions and certainly have a role in society. Invoking an example from Herzog, the Manhattan phonebook is unquestionably a dull, dry, read, but indeed is a very helpful tool if you’re looking to place a phone call. Likewise, with a little analysis of the volume of individuals listed and the economic services advertised in the back-pages, the phonebook could provide a vaguely accurate portrait of what life in Manhattan looked like at the time of its publication, but the portrait they paint is vacant, only ghostly specters running through a preordained protocol of statistics and historical events. Missing from all this evidence is the deeper stuff: the hopes, dreams, pet peeves, etc., of people roaming those streets. This is why some of the most insightful archeological discoveries are not great construction projects, but the lewd and salacious graffiti carved into them.

The ecstatic truth  has a few unfortunate cousins: the Op-Ed, advertisement and propaganda. Although mentioned separately, there is very little difference between them: works on this end of the spectrum are qualified by an intention to control, by demanding the acceptance of the subjected truths they present regardless of their relationship to “fact” (i.e. our soap makes you sexy, our beer makes you cool, U-S-A, All-The-Way!, and so on…).

While propaganda seeks to limit questions and establish control; the ecstatic truth seeks to inspire emotional connections, while inviting critique and scrutiny by the viewer.

> “[A] decisive difference is that either I make public acknowledgement of my ecstatic inventions, or it’s clear from the film itself. The explanation is usually in the film itself, and is impossible to ignore.” — **Werner Herzog**.
>
> Herzog has always been upfront regarding his style and approach. His pictures often read as immersive thought experiments, borrowing bits from reality and fiction, they each have their own established tone, providing the viewer with clues as to the treatment of the materials within. Tiny fictions that reside within a greater non-fiction — and, as stated above, as inventive and good natured as the stories you hear over beers with friends at the local pub.

Concerns regarding the application of the Ecstatic or Emotional truth ultimately boil down to issues of media literacy and transparency. Producers and consumers of media alike should focus on taking an active role in their relationship to media, keeping an open minded about how the documentary format is applied, and asking oneself where on the spectrum the work lies.

I will leave the final word to Werner:

> “No one knows what it is, truth. Least of all the author. But philosophers don’t know either, nor mathematicians, not even the Pope in Rome knows what it is… Just this: I don’t think truth is some kind of polestar in the sky that we will one day get to. It’s more like an incessant striving. A seeking full of futile endeavor. But it is a journey into the unknown, into a vast twilit forest, that gives our lives meaning and purpose; it is what distinguishes us from the beasts in the field.”
